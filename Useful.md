To create a new projetc in react we have to first create a folder then enter on it and run ->npm start
extensions:
ext install dsznajder.es7-react-js-snippets

React icons we have to install it and then go to the website to choose the one we want


To generate the following code in app.jsx we can write rafce :
    import React from 'react'

    const App = () => {
    return (
        <div>App</div>
    )
    }

    export default App

N.B : Each part of the website ( our homepage) is going to be a components
      Each component has its own folder
      each component is going to have its own jsx file, css file and js file(depend of our need)


We import a google font and put at the top of our index.css file

N.B : All the components are going to be write in a section tag

N.B : .container container_div create <div className="container container_div"></div>

We can create many component in one folder

Then in the App.jsx file
we will import all the component in order 
Ctrl+w : Permit to close all the file open in vscode
