To create a new projetc in react we have to first create a folder then enter on it and run ->npm start
extensions:
ext install dsznajder.es7-react-js-snippets


To generate the following code in app.jsx we can write rafce :
    import React from 'react'

    const App = () => {
    return (
        <div>App</div>
    )
    }

    export default App

N.B : Each part of the website ( our homepage) is going to be a components
      Each component has its own folder
      each component is going to have its own jsx file, css file and js file(depend of our need)


We import a google font and put at the top of our index.css file

N.B : All the components are going to be write in a section tag

Then in the App.jsx file
we will import all the component in order 
Ctrl+w : Permit to close all the file open in vscode
